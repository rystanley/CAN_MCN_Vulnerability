**Abstract**

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are critical in safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem functions under climate change. The long-term effectiveness of these static conservation measures will depend on how well they represent current and future ocean changes. Here, we use the Climate Risk Index for Biodiversity to assess the vulnerability representation of marine ecosystems within the Canadian Marine Conservation Network (CMCN) under two divergent emissions scenarios. We found that MPAs best represent climate vulnerability in Atlantic Canada (85% representativity overall, and 93% in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence under low emissions), followed by the Pacific (78%) and Arctic (63%; lowest in the Eastern Arctic (41% under high emissions) regions. Notably, MPAs with lower climate vulnerability are proportionally overrepresented in the CMCN. Broad-scale geographic targets employed in the Scotian Shelf-Bay of Fundy network planning process achieve over 90% representativity of climate vulnerabilities, underscoring the importance of ensuring habitat representativity and geographic distribution in conservation planning to enhance climate resilience, even if not explicitly prioritized. Moving towards Canada’s target to protect 30% of its waters by 2030, prioritizing representativity and designation of MPAs in currently underrepresented climate-vulnerable regions may be crucial to enhancing the resilience of the CMCN amidst an ever-changing climate.

__Figure 2__ Within each 0.5° x 0.5° grid cell across the Canadian geographic distribution of a species (a), 12 standardized climate indices were calculated (b) and used to define the three dimensions of climate vulnerability (c) according to Boyce et al. 2022. These dimensions were used to calculate species’ vulnerability and combined to represent climate vulnerability for ecosystems. Marine Conservation Areas, including MPAs and Marine Refuges, are depicted in each map.

__Figure 3__ Density plots of climate vulnerability distributions for three oceans (Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic) under two climate scenarios (RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6) in ocean basins (in red) and within conservation networks (in blue-green). Vulnerabilities are weighted by cell area. Area-weighted medians of distributions are shown as vertical lines in their respective colours.

Vertical lines indicate area-weighted medians and circles represent outliers. Distributions are weighted by area.

__Figure 5__ (a) Representativity of the conservation network in a given bioregion (n=9), expressed as the percent overlap of the distributions of vulnerability in the network compared to the bioregion as a whole. (b) Changes in representativity between high emissions (RCP 8.5) and low emissions (RCP 2.6). Positive values indicate the conservation network will become more representative of bioregional vulnerabilities under RCP 8.5 compared to RCP 2.6. Colours represent weighted median vulnerability of the bioregion under RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6. Shapes represent emissions scenarios.

Vulnerabilities are weighted by cell area. Area-weighted medians of distributions are shown as vertical lines in their respective colours.
